This is a small/fast/cool/dumb program i made in C, it replicates a command line/terminal and i did make this before but i refaccctored the entire damn thing to make it more;
modular, cooler, more 'shell' commands, etc
this is version <2.1.8> but there will def be more versions coming out with evan more cool programs, fetures, easter eggs (there are some in there), 'shell' commands, etc.
you can also type 'help' in the terminal to get command help also if you can make this better, please do.

(to compile make sure you are in the 'src' directory, then type: "gcc -o ApacheTerminal Main.c Functions/Programs/*.h -lm -lreadline")
