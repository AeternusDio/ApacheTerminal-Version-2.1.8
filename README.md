This is a small/fast/cool/dumb program i made in C, it replicates a command line/terminal and i did make this before but i refaccctored the entire damn thing to make it more;
modular, cooler, more 'shell' commands, etc
this is version <2.1.8> but there will def be more versions coming out with evan more cool programs, fetures, easter eggs (there are some in there), 'shell' commands, etc.
you can also go into the file 'AT-SHELL.md' to see all of the commands documentations and other commands. also if you can make this better, please do.
